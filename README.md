This is the full project version of Retelling the Tell-Tale Heart! This project's version number is currently 1.01.

If you are just looking to play the game itself, you can do that here: https://kenton-taylor-howard.itch.io/retelling-the-tell-tale-heart

If you are looking to access the source code for the game (including some code comments from me on how it works) you can do that from here in severeal ways.  If you are familiar with Git, you can clone this repository to your computer to make a copy of it. If you aren't, you can use the .zip file option on this page to download a zipped folder and unzip it.

Either way, you'll need the inky editor (or some other code editor) to view the game's code.  Open the .ink file to check it out.  You can also see the custom CSS I created for the game by opening the .CSS file in a code editor.
